# OS NGD Analytical

These are SLD files for OS NGD Analytical in Geopackage format for use in GeoServer.

*They have been designed to work with the data loaded into a database, for example PostGIS, with field names in full and in lowercase.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/osngd-resources/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository.

**2.**  Load your OS NGD Analytical data into GeoServer.

**3.**  Add the styles. If using the GUI then navigate to Styles > Add a new style > Browse and select to add each file in turn.

**4.**  Publish these styles with the data. If using the GUI then navigate to Layers > Add a new resource and choose them from the relevant database to add each file in turn, click on publish, configure settings and then choose the matching style before saving.

The name of this Layer Group is the ‘layer’ your web map service (WMS) will need to call.
